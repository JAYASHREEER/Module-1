# Experiment No: 1e â€“ SEB-Minimum of Two Float Numbers

## AIM  
To write a Python program to find the minimum between two float numbers using a conditional expression (Ternary operator).

## ALGORITHM  
1.Start the program
Begin by setting up the Python environment.
2.Input two float numbers
Prompt the user to enter two float numbers using the input() function and convert them to float.
3.Find the minimum using the ternary operator
Use the conditional expression:
minimum = num1 if num1 < num2 else num2
to determine the smaller number.
4.Display the result
Print the minimum number using the print() function.

## PROGRAM
x=float(input())
y=float(input())
mini=(x if(x<y) else y)
print(f"The minimum of {x} and {y} is {mini}")

## RESULT
Thus,the Python program to find the minimum between two float numbers using a conditional expression (Ternary operator) was implemented and successfully executed.
